		  '<p><br><br><br><b>Study debrief</b></p><p>Thank you for completing this study. The purpose of this study is to investigate how consumers utilise information from online product reviews when choosing between different products. Specifically, this study is interested in better understanding how the perceived popularity of a product affects tendencies to prefer it over other products. In this study, popularity is represented by the number of reviews that a product has. Previous research has noted that online consumers are biased towards choosing more-reviewed, and thus more popular, products over less-reviewed products. Consumers have been observed to do this even when the less popular product has a higher star rating, and thus of superior quality. When they do this, consumers may be inferring information about the quality of the products from popularity, whereby more popular products are assumed to be of superior quality. This study seeks to understand why consumers display this bias: whether it is a biological, social imperative like herding, or whether it is a rational decision-making strategy, like an educated guess. To distinguish between these two possibilities, some participants were told that more-reviewed products have been on the market longer than less-reviewed products. The purpose of this was to attribute the difference in number of reviews to something other than product quality. Such an explanation would make it inappropriate to infer quality information from the number of reviews. If consumers who receive the explanation do not display the bias, this study would provide evidence that the bias is not due to a social compulsion, but a decision-making strategy that consumers can selectively implement, as appropriate. <br><br>Your responses will be kept anonymous and stored securely at The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. If you have any questions about this study please contact <b>Mr. Ashton Wisken (a.r.wisken@student.unsw.edu.au)</b> or <b>Ms. Peggy Wei (p.wei@unsw.edu.au).</b> If you feel distressed by your participation in this study and would like to access free telephone counselling in the United States, please call USA (Lifeline Chat 1-800-273-8255).</p>' +
